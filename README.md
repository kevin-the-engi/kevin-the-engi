Hey, Kevin here! :raising_hand_man: </br>
I was formerly a 3D Artist in Mobile Game Development. :video_game:	 </br>
My responsibilities included creating 3D assets for use in a 3D engine, creating texture maps, implementing animations, and documenting the pipeline. 

I am now a Software Developer working on creating applications with the technologies I have learned and will continue learning more. :man_student:
